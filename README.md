# TT Environment Mapping Guidelines

## When is RT2 required?
RT2 is used when:
- Controlled Access = Yes
- Limited Access = Yes
- The section is a Motorway (CA = Yes)

## How accurate should geometry be?
In TT environments like `WEU_TT_BW`, geometry should align with real road surfaces as seen in HD lidar data. Try to replicate that as closely as possible even on SD level.
